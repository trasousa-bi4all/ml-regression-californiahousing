# Introduction

More and More the computing systems inspired by biological neural networks to perform different tasks with a huge amount of data involved *artificial neural networks* or ANN, are used all across the industry. 

Different algorithms are used to understand the relationships in a given set of data to produce the best results from the changing inputs. The network is trained to produce the desired outputs, and different models are used to predict the future results with the data. The nodes are interconnected so that it works like a human brain. Different correlations and hidden patterns in raw data are used to cluster and classify the data. (If this short introduction intrigued you, follow along with this use case).

If at any point you feel you need more information go to this [link](https://github.com/BI4ALL/ml-welcome-ai-ml-learning-toolkit/blob/main/data-science-introduction/artificial-neural-network-introduction.md) and consolidate your knowledge.

At folder *src* you have a notebook to follow all steps to implement a Multilayer Perceptron. Additionally, there is a README file to help you to configure a Conda Environment.

# Goal

The goal of this use case is to help you give your first steps in the world of **Neural Networks** and explore some of the most used libraries, *Keras* and *TensorFllow* as well as some features of these libraries.
For that, we will solve some simple regression problems using a well-known dataset the *California Housing Dataset*. 

# Data

The *California Housing Dataset* dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S.
Census Bureau publishes sample data. The target variable is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).


# Setup

If you haven't set up the required tools yet (**VS Code**, **Git** and **Anaconda**), please go to [this repository](https://github.com/BI4ALL/ml-usecase-environmentsetup) and follow the instructions and the video to complete the required setup.
